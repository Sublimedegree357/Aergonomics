### **Project Title:**
**Aergonomics: A Cross-Chain DEX with Dynamic Fees, Impermanent Loss Protection, and Flexible Liquidity Provisioning**

---

### **1. Pitch Deck Outline**

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
- **Aergonomics: The Future of Cross-Chain DeFi**
- **Subtitle:** Single-Sided & Dual-Sided Liquidity, Dynamic Fees, and IL Protection on Aergo
- **Logo and Team**

#### **Slide 2: Problem**
- **Complex Liquidity Provision**: LPs need to provide two assets, exposing them to impermanent loss and complicated fee structures.
- **Impermanent Loss**: LPs risk significant loss when asset prices diverge, limiting DEX liquidity.
- **Lack of Cross-Chain Solutions**: Traditional DEXes are limited to single-chain liquidity, requiring wrapped assets for cross-chain swaps.

#### **Slide 3: Solution**
- **Single-Sided Liquidity Provision**: LPs can provide liquidity with only one asset, reducing complexity and exposure to impermanent loss.
- **Dual-Sided Liquidity Provision**: Option for experienced LPs to provide both assets in a pair for more flexibility and higher rewards.
- **Impermanent Loss Protection**: Automated rebalancing and an insurance fund compensate LPs for impermanent loss.
- **Cross-Chain Native Swaps**: ThorChain integration for native, decentralized swaps without wrapped tokens.

#### **Slide 4: Key Features**
- **Single- and Dual-Sided Liquidity**: LPs can provide liquidity with only one asset or both, minimizing risk while maximizing flexibility.
- **Dynamic Fees**: Chainlink oracles monitor market conditions, adjusting fees in real-time to ensure fair compensation for LPs during high volatility.
- **Impermanent Loss Mitigation**: Aergonomics provides rebalancing algorithms and an insurance fund to protect LPs.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Powered by ThorChain, native assets are swapped without centralized exchanges or wrapping.

#### **Slide 5: Tokenomics**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 AERGOX Tokens
- **Distribution**:
  - **Liquidity Providers**: 40%
  - **Governance & Staking**: 25%
  - **Team & Development**: 15%
  - **Ecosystem Incentives**: 10%
  - **Reserve Fund**: 5%
  - **Marketing & Partnerships**: 5%
- **Emission Schedule**: A long-term emission plan, reducing over 10 years to ensure liquidity incentives while balancing inflation.

#### **Slide 6: DAO Governance**
- **Aergonomics DAO**: Community-governed protocol where token holders (AERGOX) can vote on major decisions.
  - **Voting Power**: Governance tokens staked in the DAO grant voting power. Token holders can propose and vote on key issues like:
    - Fee structure changes
    - Insurance fund adjustments
    - Liquidity pool incentives
    - Future protocol upgrades
  - **Staking Mechanism**: LPs and AERGOX holders stake tokens for governance, yielding rewards based on contributions.

#### **Slide 7: Milestone-Based Roadmap**
- **Q1 2024**: Research and Initial Development
  - Smart contract development, single-sided liquidity, and dynamic fee testing.
- **Q2 2024**: Testnet Launch and Audits
  - Deploy on Aergo testnet, integrate Chainlink oracles and ThorChain.
  - Security audits and impermanent loss simulations.
- **Q3 2024**: Mainnet Launch
  - Launch on Aergo mainnet with single- and dual-sided liquidity options, cross-chain native swaps.
  - Initial token distribution and liquidity mining program.
- **Q4 2024**: Governance Launch
  - Activate Aergonomics DAO for community-driven decision-making.
