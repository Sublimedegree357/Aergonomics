**Aergonomics** aims to provide a comprehensive cross-chain DEX solution that addresses the complexities of providing liquidity and trading assets across different blockchain ecosystems. The project features two key liquidity provisioning methods—**single-sided liquidity** and **dual-sided liquidity**—with mechanisms to reduce **impermanent loss**, dynamic fees based on market conditions, and cross-chain functionality powered by **ThorChain** and **Chainlink oracles**.

Here’s a detailed explanation of each component, including how the system interacts, how it solves current problems, and some **code examples** to illustrate the technical architecture.

### **1. Liquidity Provisioning**

**Liquidity Provisioning** is a core feature of any DEX. Aergonomics will offer two distinct models:

#### **1.1. Single-Sided Liquidity Provision**
**Problem Addressed**: In traditional DEXes, liquidity providers (LPs) have to provide both assets of a trading pair (e.g., ADA/AERGO), which can expose them to impermanent loss. This is complicated for users who only hold or prefer to supply a single asset.

**Solution**: In Aergonomics, LPs can deposit a single token into a liquidity pool. This is made possible through **synthetic asset creation**. For example, an LP deposits only ADA, and the protocol synthetically balances the pool by pairing it with a virtual counterpart of AERGO. The LP only bears the price risk of ADA, not the entire trading pair.

##### **Code: Single-Sided Liquidity Contract**

```solidity
// SingleSidedLiquidity.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract SingleSidedLiquidity {

    struct LiquidityProvider {
        uint256 tokenAmount;  // Amount of single-sided token provided
        uint256 timestamp;    // Time of deposit
    }

    IERC20 public token;      // Token provided by LP (e.g., ADA)
    uint256 public totalLiquidity;  // Total liquidity in the pool

    mapping(address => LiquidityProvider) public liquidityProviders;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress) {
        token = IERC20(_tokenAddress);  // Set token (ADA in this example)
    }

    // Single-sided liquidity deposit
    function depositLiquidity(uint256 _amount) external {
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);  // Transfer tokens to the pool

        liquidityProviders[msg.sender] = LiquidityProvider({
            tokenAmount: _amount,
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        });

        totalLiquidity += _amount;
    }

    // Single-sided liquidity withdrawal
    function withdrawLiquidity(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(liquidityProviders[msg.sender].tokenAmount >= _amount, "Insufficient liquidity");

        liquidityProviders[msg.sender].tokenAmount -= _amount;
        totalLiquidity -= _amount;

        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);  // Return the original token to LP
    }

    // Check liquidity balance
    function checkLiquidity(address _lp) external view returns (uint256) {
        return liquidityProviders[_lp].tokenAmount;
    }
}
```

#### **1.2. Dual-Sided Liquidity Provision**
**Problem Addressed**: Dual-sided liquidity is required for traditional DEXs, but it exposes LPs to impermanent loss if one asset in the pair experiences significant price changes. Dual-sided liquidity, however, tends to create deeper liquidity pools and more stable pricing for traders.

**Solution**: Aergonomics will support dual-sided liquidity pools where LPs provide both assets of a trading pair (e.g., ADA/AERGO). To mitigate impermanent loss, Aergonomics offers **dynamic rebalancing** and **insurance funds**, allowing LPs to participate without high-risk exposure. The fee structure rewards LPs with balanced deposits between pairs.

##### **Code: Dual-Sided Liquidity Contract**

```solidity
// DualSidedLiquidity.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract DualSidedLiquidity {

    struct LiquidityProvider {
        uint256 token1Amount;
        uint256 token2Amount;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    IERC20 public token1;    // Asset 1 (e.g., ADA)
    IERC20 public token2;    // Asset 2 (e.g., AERGO)

    mapping(address => LiquidityProvider) public liquidityProviders;

    uint256 public totalLiquidityToken1;
    uint256 public totalLiquidityToken2;

    constructor(address _token1, address _token2) {
        token1 = IERC20(_token1);
        token2 = IERC20(_token2);
    }

    // Deposit both assets for dual-sided liquidity
    function depositLiquidity(uint256 _token1Amount, uint256 _token2Amount) external {
        token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _token1Amount);
        token2.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _token2Amount);

        liquidityProviders[msg.sender] = LiquidityProvider({
            token1Amount: _token1Amount,
            token2Amount: _token2Amount,
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        });

        totalLiquidityToken1 += _token1Amount;
        totalLiquidityToken2 += _token2Amount;
    }

    // Withdraw liquidity from the dual-sided pool
    function withdrawLiquidity(uint256 _token1Amount, uint256 _token2Amount) external {
        LiquidityProvider storage provider = liquidityProviders[msg.sender];
        require(provider.token1Amount >= _token1Amount && provider.token2Amount >= _token2Amount, "Insufficient balance");

        provider.token1Amount -= _token1Amount;
        provider.token2Amount -= _token2Amount;

        totalLiquidityToken1 -= _token1Amount;
        totalLiquidityToken2 -= _token2Amount;

        token1.transfer(msg.sender, _token1Amount);
        token2.transfer(msg.sender, _token2Amount);
    }
}
```

### **2. Dynamic Fee Adjustment**

**Problem Addressed**: Fixed trading fees don’t account for market conditions, and traders may be overpaying or underpaying for trades based on liquidity volatility.

**Solution**: **Dynamic fees** that adjust based on real-time market data help optimize trading costs and improve liquidity utilization. By using **Chainlink oracles** to monitor asset prices and volatility, the DEX can automatically increase fees during periods of high volatility to compensate LPs for the increased risk, and lower fees during stable periods.

##### **Code: Dynamic Fee Calculation Based on Volatility**

```solidity
// DynamicFees.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract DynamicFees {

    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;

    uint256 public baseFee = 1; // Default fee of 1%
    uint256 public maxFee = 5;  // Maximum fee of 5%

    constructor(address _priceFeed) {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);  // Chainlink price feed
    }

    // Dynamic fee adjustment based on price volatility
    function getDynamicFee() public view returns (uint256) {
        (,int256 price,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        uint256 volatility = calculateVolatility(price);

        if (volatility > 10) {
            return maxFee;  // Maximum fee in volatile conditions
        } else if (volatility > 5) {
            return baseFee + 2;  // Increased fee for moderate volatility
        } else {
            return baseFee;  // Base fee for stable conditions
        }
    }

    // Simplified volatility calculation
    function calculateVolatility(int256 price) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return uint256(price) % 10;  // Placeholder for volatility calculation
    }
}
```

### **3. Impermanent Loss Mitigation**

**Problem Addressed**: **Impermanent loss (IL)** is the main risk for LPs in DEXs. When prices of paired assets diverge significantly, LPs can suffer losses compared to simply holding the assets. Many DEXes don’t have effective measures to mitigate this risk.

**Solution**: Aergonomics provides an **insurance fund** to compensate LPs for impermanent loss. Part of the trading fees are allocated to this fund, which LPs can claim in the event of significant IL. Additionally, **rebalancing algorithms** help minimize the impact by adjusting liquidity pools when price divergence is detected.

##### **Code: Impermanent Loss Insurance Fund**

```solidity
// ImpermanentLossInsurance.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ImpermanentLossInsurance {

    uint256 public totalInsurancePool;
    mapping(address => uint256) public insuranceBalances;

    // Contribute to the insurance fund
    function contributeToInsuranceFund() external payable {
        insuranceBalances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalInsurancePool += msg.value;
    }

    // Claim insurance for impermanent loss
    function claimInsurance(address _lp, uint256 _lossAmount) external {
        require(totalInsurancePool >= _lossAmount, "Insufficient pool funds");

        totalInsurancePool -= _lossAmount;
        payable(_lp).transfer(_lossAmount);
    }

    // Check insurance balance of a liquidity provider
    function checkInsuranceBalance(address _provider) external view returns (uint256) {
        return insuranceBalances[_provider];
    }
}
```

### **4. Cross-Chain Asset Swaps**

**Problem Addressed**: Cross-chain trading is typically complicated, requiring wrapping assets or using centralized exchanges. It’s difficult to move native assets like BTC or ADA across different blockchains without

 centralized intermediaries.

**Solution**: **ThorChain** enables native cross-chain swaps without wrapping tokens. Aergonomics integrates ThorChain for seamless native swaps, ensuring users can swap assets like BTC for AERGO directly, without needing to convert them into wrapped assets.

---

### **Complete Flow Overview:**

1. **Liquidity Provisioning**: Users can choose between single-sided or dual-sided liquidity provision. Single-sided LPs provide one asset, and the system balances the pool using synthetic assets. Dual-sided LPs deposit both assets in a trading pair.

2. **Trading**: Users can trade across different assets, leveraging cross-chain liquidity via ThorChain. Dynamic fees are applied based on market volatility, adjusting in real-time to optimize trade costs.

3. **Impermanent Loss Mitigation**: LPs benefit from automatic rebalancing of liquidity pools to minimize impermanent loss. If significant IL occurs, LPs can claim compensation from the insurance fund.

4. **Governance**: A community-governed DAO oversees the protocol, adjusting parameters like fee structures, insurance fund sizes, and liquidity incentives through decentralized voting.




# Aergonomics
Detailed Explanation of How the Aergonomics Project Will Work
### **What Type of DEX is Aergonomics?**

Aergonomics is a **cross-chain, multi-liquidity DEX** (Decentralized Exchange) built on **Aergo**, with integrations to **ThorChain** and **Chainlink oracles**. It focuses on providing flexible liquidity provisioning options, impermanent loss protection, and dynamic fee structures. Let’s break down its key characteristics:

1. **Cross-Chain DEX**:
   - Aergonomics allows **native cross-chain swaps** through ThorChain, which means users can swap tokens between different blockchains (e.g., BTC to AERGO) without relying on wrapped tokens or centralized exchanges. This enables seamless interoperability across blockchain ecosystems.

2. **Liquidity Flexibility**:
   - **Single-Sided Liquidity Provision**: LPs (Liquidity Providers) can deposit a single asset into liquidity pools, reducing complexity and exposure to impermanent loss. This is advantageous for users who hold or want to supply just one token.
   - **Dual-Sided Liquidity Provision**: LPs can also provide liquidity for both assets in a trading pair, enabling deeper liquidity pools for more experienced users who prefer this model.

3. **Dynamic Fees**:
   - The platform uses **Chainlink oracles** to track market volatility in real-time and adjusts fees accordingly. This means fees are lower during periods of stability and higher during volatile markets, providing better compensation to LPs while optimizing trading costs for users.

4. **Impermanent Loss Mitigation**:
   - The protocol offers an **insurance fund** to compensate LPs for impermanent loss (IL). Additionally, **automatic rebalancing algorithms** help mitigate price divergence in liquidity pools, reducing the financial risks LPs face when prices fluctuate significantly.

5. **Community-Governed DAO**:
   - Aergonomics is governed by a **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**, where token holders can propose and vote on protocol changes such as fee structures, liquidity incentives, and insurance fund adjustments. This ensures decentralized decision-making and long-term adaptability.

SUCCESS FACTORS

Several factors contribute to the potential success of Aergonomics, but it will also face challenges. Let’s examine both the strengths and obstacles:

#### **Key Strengths:**
1. **Cross-Chain Capability**:
   - By integrating **ThorChain** for native cross-chain swaps, Aergonomics stands out as a truly **interoperable DEX**. Cross-chain functionality is a highly sought-after feature in DeFi, and ThorChain’s infrastructure allows seamless swaps without needing wrapped tokens or relying on centralized exchanges.

2. **Flexible Liquidity Provision**:
   - Offering **single-sided liquidity** is a significant innovation that reduces barriers to entry for liquidity providers. LPs don’t need to hold both assets in a trading pair, which lowers the risk of impermanent loss and simplifies participation.
   - At the same time, the option for **dual-sided liquidity** allows more experienced LPs to earn higher fees and participate in deeper liquidity pools.

3. **Impermanent Loss Protection**:
   - Impermanent loss is one of the primary concerns for LPs, and Aergonomics addresses this through both **rebalancing mechanisms** and **insurance funds**. This will attract more liquidity providers, as it offers protection against one of the biggest risks in DeFi.

4. **Dynamic Fee Structure**:
   - By using **dynamic fees** based on real-time market conditions, Aergonomics can optimize the user experience for traders and LPs. This ensures that trading fees are more reflective of market conditions and provide fair compensation to liquidity providers during periods of high volatility.

5. **Community-Driven Governance**:
   - A **DAO governance model** empowers the community, allowing token holders to have a say in the evolution of the platform. This can lead to long-term sustainability as decisions are decentralized and based on the needs and preferences of users.
